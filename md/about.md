Oh, hello.

I’m Chaofeng (Chao) Zhou. I build at the intersection of technology, intelligence, and personal growth — designing systems and decoding complexity into leverage.

My career runs through high-scale engineering environments — Meta, Amazon, and Blend — where I’ve worked on distributed systems, backend architecture, and optimization ML algorithms operating at scale. My focus has consistently been performance under constraint: latency, cost, reliability, and incentive alignment.

My interests extended beyond engineering into social science and the liberal arts was sparked by my time at Yale. I’m drawn to how systems shape behavior — markets, platforms, institutions, and the psychological layer beneath them. Technology is never just technical; it reorganizes incentives and rewrites structures.

I’ve been developing the PROFIT-S model — a structured lens for evaluating products and platforms through Pain, Reality, Optimization, Funnel, Integrity, Toughness, and Stewardship.

Chaos is not noise. 

It is unstructured potential.
